# CM4044 Mini Project 1

A mini project for CM4044-AI for Chemistry. This is a graded assignment for NTU CBC course CM4044.

The codes were written in conjunction with 2 other friends, Ding Jie and Zhi Chao. 
First attempt on coding a CNN using Pytorch to classify histopathological images.

Codes were written using Pytorch library. Images are available in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images

Comprised of 3 folders and 1 notebook

1. csv folder contains the training loss and validation loss that was obtain while doing the hyperparameter search.

2. trained_model folder contain models that was trained under various conditions as stated in the notebook. 

3. images folder contains the plots of training loss and validation loss obtained while doing hyperparameter search. 

4. cnn_final.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that contains all the codes including hyperparameter searching, cnn model architecture, train, validate and testing and lastly, a visualisation on the accuracy of model. 

5. python_script_folder --> currently working on converting codes to python scripts so that it can be used via command line.
